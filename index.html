    <h3 class="header">Welcome to my website!</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Aaron, and I am a 3rd-year student studying computer science at
      Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. I am planning on
      pursuing my bachelors and masters degrees in computer science here at WPI.

    <h4 class="header">About me</h4>
    <p>
      Outside of school, I like playing basketball, cooking, playing video
      games, and of course coding in my free time. I also work at theCoderSchool
      in Sudbury, MA where I teach kids of many ages to code in languages like
      JavaScript, Python, and Scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      At WPI, I'm the activities manager of the Greenhouse and Horticulture
      club, a member of the computer science honor society Upsilon Pi Epsilon,
      and a member of a joint computer/data science and materials science
      research team studying powders and how they flow.
