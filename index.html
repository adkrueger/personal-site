          My name is Aaron, and I am a 3rd-year student studying computer
          science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. I am
          planning on pursuing my bachelors and masters degrees in computer
          science here at WPI.

        At WPI, I'm the activities manager of the Greenhouse and Horticulture
        Club, a member of the computer science honor society Upsilon Pi Epsilon,
        and a member of a joint computer/data science and materials science
        research team studying powders and how they flow. I'll also be a student
        assistant starting Fall 2020, where I'll get to help peers with their
        classes.

        Outside of school, I like playing basketball, cooking, playing video
        games, and of course coding in my free time. I also work at
        theCoderSchool in Sudbury, MA where I teach kids of many ages to code in
        languages like JavaScript, Python, and Scratch.

        In summer of 2020 (the summer of my sophomore year), I worked at
        MathWorks in Natick, MA as an Engineering Development Group (EDG)
        Intern. MathWorks is best known for their main product MATLAB, and I
        worked on the Release Engineering team. In this role, I used MathWorks'
        internal continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools
        to make sure that MATLAB, Simulink, and other products built and tested
        without failures. This gave me a great opportunity to work outside of my
        comfort zone and learn a lot about the software development lifecycle. I
        also worked with SQL and Perl to create a tool that is used internally
        every two weeks to compile information and send out emails about it.
