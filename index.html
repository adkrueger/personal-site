      My name is Aaron, and I am a 3rd-year student studying computer science at
      Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. I am planning on
      pursuing my bachelors and masters degrees in computer science here at WPI.

      <p>
        Outside of school, I like playing basketball, cooking, playing video
        games, and of course coding in my free time. I also work at
        theCoderSchool in Sudbury, MA where I teach kids of many ages to code in
        languages like JavaScript, Python, and Scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        At WPI, I'm the activities manager of the Greenhouse and Horticulture
        Club, a member of the computer science honor society Upsilon Pi Epsilon,
        and a member of a joint computer/data science and materials science
        research team studying powders and how they flow. I'll also be a student
        assistant starting Fall 2020, where I'll get to help peers with their
        classes.

        In summer of 2020 (the summer of my sophomore year), I worked at
        MathWorks in Natick, MA as an Engineering Development Group (EDG)
        Intern. MathWorks is best known for their main product MATLAB, and I
        worked on the Release Engineering team. In this role, I used MathWorks'
        internal continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools
        to make sure that MATLAB, Simulink, and other products built and tested
        without failures. This gave me a great opportunity to work outside of my
        comfort zone and learn a lot about the software development lifecycle. I
        also worked with SQL and Perl to create a tool that is used internally
        every two weeks to compile information and send out emails about it.

        In the summer of 2020, I worked as an EDG Intern at MathWorks in Natick,
        MA. I learned about CI/CD and developed an internal tool as a member of
        the Release Engineering team and got a great overview of the software
        development lifecycle.
